* Introduction
This is the main file of the system. First, we will define the vrp package. Then, we define the classes used to create a vrp problem. 

* Package definition

The first thing to do is to create the package we are going to be working in.


#+BEGIN_SRC elisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle ../src/vrp.lisp 
(defpackage :vrp
  (:use :cl-user :common-lisp)
  (:shadow random round)
  (:export pp-solution))

(in-package :vrp)
#+END_SRC
