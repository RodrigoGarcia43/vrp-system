#+TITLE: Neighborhood Statistic Techniques

* Description
  In this file, I'm going to define some statistical techniques that will be
  used to identify the most promising regions in the neighborhood.
  The src blocks will be tangled to ../src/neigh-statistics.lisp.


* Add the package to the tangled files
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle ../src/neigh-statistics.lisp
    (in-package :vrp)
  #+END_SRC



* Mean technique

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle ../src/neigh-statistics.lisp
    (defun mean-technique (neighborhood result-table region-id-list file-name)
      ;; the next line of code is added in order to avoid a warning
      ;; message since file-name parameter is not used in the function
      (declare (ignore file-name))
      ;; (format t "Mean technique~%")
      (mapcar #'(lambda (tuple) (cdr tuple))
	      (sort
	       (loop for id in region-id-list
		  collect
		    (let* ((key (nth (1- id) (region-keys neighborhood)))
			   (lst (gethash key result-table)))
		      (cons (/ (apply #'+ lst) (length lst))			  
			    id)))
	       #'< :key #'car)))
  #+END_SRC
